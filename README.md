### Mission Statement
: We are sick of products that barely survive the warranty period, let alone long enough to survive us. We intend to make our products as art pieces of heirloom quality that, with proper maintenance and care, should remain serviceable for generations.

### About Us
: The concept of being "grunt-proof" comes from the US Marine Corps infantry where the quality and usefulness of an item is directly related to how long it takes to break. We are a collective of collaborating artists dedicated to creating items that can withstand the wear, tear, and abuse commonly experienced whilst under field conditions.

### Mashkawaa
